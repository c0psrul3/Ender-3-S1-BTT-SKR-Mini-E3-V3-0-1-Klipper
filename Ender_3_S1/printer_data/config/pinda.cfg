[probe]
pin: ^HermitCrab:PB1
#deactivate_on_each_sample: True
x_offset: -39.0
y_offset: -1
#z_offset: 0
speed: 10.0
samples: 3
sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.
