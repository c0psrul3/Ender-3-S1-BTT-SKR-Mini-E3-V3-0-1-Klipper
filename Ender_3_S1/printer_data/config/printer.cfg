# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2021 Creality Ender 3
# S1 & S1 Pro. To use this config, check the STM32 Chip on the
# Mainboard, during "make menuconfig" select accordingly either the
# STM32F103 with "28KiB bootloader" or the STM32F401 with
# "64KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) for both.

# For a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig" select
# "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and  Serial
# (on USART2 PA3/PA2), which is on the 10 pin IDC cable used
# for the LCD module as follows: 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The filename
# must be changed to "firmware.bin"

# With STM32F401, you might need to put "firmware.bin" in a
# folder on the SD card called "STM32F4_UPDATE" in order to flash.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

[verify_heater extruder]
max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
#check_gain_time: 20
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
#heating_gain: 2
